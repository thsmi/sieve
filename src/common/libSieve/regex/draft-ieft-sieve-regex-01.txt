          Sieve Email Filtering: Regular Expression Extension
                     draft-ietf-sieve-regex-01.txt

Abstract

   This document describes the "regex" extension to the Sieve email
   filtering language.  In some cases, it is desirable to have a string
   matching mechanism which is more powerful than a simple exact match,
   a substring match or a glob-style wildcard match.  The regular
   expression matching mechanism defined in this draft provides users
   with much more powerful string matching capabilities.

Change History (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)

   Changes from draft-murchison-sieve-regex-08:

   o  Updated to XML source.

   o  Documented interaction with variables.

   Changes from draft-ietf-sieve-regex-00:

   o  Added trial text specifying comparator interactions.

Open Issues (to be removed prior to publication as an RFC)

   o  The major open issue with this draft is what to do, if anything,
      about localization/internationalization.  Are [IEEE.1003-2.1992]
      collating sequences and character equivalents sufficient?  Should
      we reference the Unicode technical specification?  Should we punt
      and publish the document as experimental?

   o  Is the current approach to comparator integration the right one to
      use?

   o  Should we allow shorthands such as \\b (word boundary) and \\w
      (word character)?

1.  Introduction

   Sieve [RFC5228] is a language for filtering email messages at or
   around the time of final delivery.  It is designed to be
   implementable on either a mail client or mail server.

Internet-Draft            Sieve Regex Extension               March 2010


   The Sieve base specification defines so-called match types for tests:
   is, contains, and matches.  An "is" test requires an exact match, a
   "contains" test provides a substring match, and "matches" provides
   glob-style wildcards.  This document describes an extension to the
   Sieve language that provides a new match type for regular expression
   comparisons.


2.  Conventions used in this document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The terms used to describe the various components of the Sieve
   language are taken from Section 1.1 of [RFC5228].


3.  Capability Identifier

   The capability string associated with the extension defined in this
   document is "regex".


4.  Regex Match Type

   When the regex extension is available, commands that support matching
   may take the optional tagged argument ":regex" to specify that a
   regular expression match should be performed.  The ":regex" match
   type is subject to the same rules and restrictions as the standard
   match types defined in [RFC5228].

   The "MATCH-TYPE" syntax element defined in [RFC5228] is augmented
   here as follows:

   MATCH-TYPE  =/  ":regex"


5.  Interaction with Sieve comparators

   In order to provide for matches between character sets and case
   insensitivity, Sieve uses the comparators defined in the Internet
   Application Protocol Collation Registry [RFC5228].  The comparator
   used by a given test is specified by the :comparator argument.

   The interaction between collators and the match types defined in the
   Sieve base specification is straightforward.  Howeer, the nature of
   regular expressions does not lend itself to this usage for the :regex

Internet-Draft            Sieve Regex Extension               March 2010


   match type.

   A component of the definition of many collators is a normalization
   operation.  For example, the "i;octet" comparator employs an identity
   normalization; whereas the "i;ascii-casema" normalizes all lower case
   ASCII characters to upper case.

   The :regex match type only uses the normalization component of the
   associated comparator.  This normalization operation is applied to
   the key-list argument to the test; the result of that normalization
   becomes the target of the regular expression comparison.  The
   comparator has no effect on the regular expression pattern or the
   underlying comparison operation.

   It is an error to specify a comparator that has no associated
   normalization operation in conjunction with a :regex match type.


6.  Regular expression comparisions

   Implementations MUST support extended regular expressions (EREs) as
   defined by [IEEE.1003-2.1992].  Any regular expression not defined by
   [IEEE.1003-2.1992], as well as [IEEE.1003-2.1992] basic regular
   expressions, word boundaries and backreferences are not supported by
   this extension.  Implementations SHOULD reject regular expressions
   that are unsupported by this specification as a syntax error.

   The following tables provide a brief summary of the regular
   expressions that MUST be supported.  This table is presented here
   only as a guideline.  [IEEE.1003-2.1992] should be used as the
   definitive reference.

7.  Interaction with Sieve Variables

   This extension is compatible with, and may be used in conjunction
   with the Sieve Variables extension [RFC5229].

7.1.  Match variables

   A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables", MUST
   set "match variables" (as defined by [RFC5229] section 3.2) whenever
   the ":regex" match type is used.  The list of match variables will
   contain the strings corresponding to the group operators in the
   regular expression.  The groups are ordered by the position of the
   opening parenthesis, from left to right.  Note that in regular
   expressions, expansions match as much as possible (greedy matching).

   Example:

   require ["fileinto", "regex", "variables"];

   if header :regex "List-ID" "<(.*)@" {
       fileinto "lists.${1}"; stop;
   }

   # Imagine the header
   # Subject: [acme-users] [fwd] version 1.0 is out
   if header :regex "Subject" "^[(.*)] (.*)$" {
       # ${1} will hold "acme-users] [fwd"
       stop;
   }

7.2.  Set modifier :quoteregex

   A sieve interpreter which supports both "regex" and "variables", MUST
   support the optional tagged argument ":quoteregex" for use with the
   "set" action.  The ":quoteregex" modifier is subject to the same
   rules and restrictions as the standard modifiers defined in [RFC5229]
   section 4.

   For convenience, the "MODIFIER" syntax element defined in [RFC5229]
   is augmented here as follows:

   MODIFIER  =/  ":quoteregex"

   This modifier adds the necessary quoting to ensure that the expanded
   text will only match a literal occurrence if used as a parameter to
   :regex.  Every character with special meaning (".", "*", "?", etc.)
   is prefixed with "\" in the expansion.  This modifier has a
   precedence value of 20 when used with other modifiers.

8.  Examples

   Example:

   require "regex";

   # Try to catch unsolicited email.
   if anyof (
     # if a message is not to me (with optional +detail),
     not address :regex ["to", "cc", "bcc"]
       "me(\\\\+.*)?@company\\\\.com",

     # or the subject is all uppercase (no lowercase)
     header :regex :comparator "i;octet" "subject"
       "^[^[:lower:]]+$" ) {

     discard;    # junk it
   }

   The following template specifies the IANA registration of the "regex"
   Sieve extension specified in this document:

   given on http://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve-extensions.


10.  Security Considerations

   General Sieve security considerations are discussed in [RFC5228].
   All of the issues described there also apply to regular expression
   matching.

   It is easy to construct problematic regular expressions that are

Internet-Draft            Sieve Regex Extension               March 2010


   computationally infeasible to evaluate.  Execution of a Sieve that
   employs a potentially problematic regular expression, such as
   "(.*)*", may cause problems ranging from degradation of performance
   to and outright denial of service.  Moreover, determining the
   computationl complexity associated with evaluating a given regular
   expression is in general an intractable problem.

   For this reason, all implementations MUST take appropriate steps to
   limit the impact of runaway regular expression evaluation.
   Implementations MAY restrict the regular expressions users are
   allowed to specify.  Implementations that do not impose such
   restrictions SHOULD provide a means to abort evaluation of tests
   using the :regex match type if the operation is taking too long.
