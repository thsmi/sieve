/**
 * Comparators specify the charset which should be used for string comparison
 * By default two matchtypes are supported.
 *
 * "i;octet"
 *   Compares strings byte by byte (octet by octet) used typically with UTF-8 octets
 *
 * "i;ascii-casemap"
 *   Converts strings before comparison to US-ASCII.
 *   All US-ASCII letters are converted to uppercase (0x61-0x7A to 0x41-0x5A)
 *   "hello" equals "HELLO"
 *
 * "i;ascii-numeric"
 *   Interprets the string as decimal positive integer represented in US-ASCII digits (0x30 to 0x39).
 *   The comparison starts from tbe beginning of the string and ends with the first non-digit or the
 *   end of string.

/**
 * 9.1.1.  ASCII Numeric Collation Description
 *
 * The "i;ascii-numeric" collation is a simple collation intended for
 * use with arbitrarily-sized, unsigned decimal integer numbers stored
 * as octet strings.  US-ASCII digits (0x30 to 0x39) represent digits of
 * the numbers.  Before converting from string to integer, the input
 * string is truncated at the first non-digit character.  All input is
 * valid; strings that do not start with a digit represent positive
 * infinity.
 *
 * The collation supports equality and ordering, but does not support
 * the substring operation.
 *
 * The equality operation returns "match" if the two strings represent
 * the same number (i.e., leading zeroes and trailing non-digits are
 * disregarded), and "no-match" if the two strings represent different
 * numbers.
 *
 * The ordering operation returns "less" if the first string represents
 * a smaller number than the second, "equal" if they represent the same
 * number, and "greater" if the first string represents a larger number
 * than the second.
 *
 * Some examples: "0" is less than "1", and "1" is less than
 * "4294967298". "4294967298", "04294967298", and "4294967298b" are all
 * equal. "04294967298" is less than "". "", "x", and "y" are equal.
