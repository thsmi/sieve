# Development Builds

Develompent builds are the bleeding-edge of the current development. They are released for 
testing after any major change. I'll be more than happy if you send me feedback on
those builds and report issues.

Keep in mind development builds might not update automatically upon release of 
the next version. They are experimental, so they most likely contain bugs and regressions. 
Thus you are using these builds at your own risk.

## Installation

1. Right-Click on the nightly build below and choose "Save Link As..." to Download and 
   save the file to your hard disk.
2. In Mozilla Thunderbird, open the addon manager (Tools Menu/Addons) 
3. Click the Install button, and locate/select the file you downloaded and click "OK"

Alternatively you can just drag and drop the downloaded file or even the link below into Thunderbird's
Addon Manager. 

The addon is restartless, so there is no need to restart Thunderbird upon installation and deinstallation.

Sometimes thunderbird fails to invalidate its cache when updating a restartless addon. The result is the new version is displayed in the addons dialog but the old cached code is still be used. In such a case uninstall the addon, then restart thunderbird, restart it again and finally install it again. This ensures the cache gets correctly invalidated.
