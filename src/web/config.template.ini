# Two authentication types are upported, a client side and a server side.
#
# Server side authentication means a proxy authorization will be  performed on
# the server side. This means no password prompt will be shown on the client.
# The reverse proxy injects the username into the http headers and you need to
# provided the credentials of a user which can authorize others in this config.
# In this case the users does not need to enter any password.
#
# Client side authentication means the authentication is performed in the users
# browser, thus the client controlls the whole authentication process and needs
# to provide his password though the UI. Keep in mind you still need to provide
# the username from the server side, either through injecting the username though
# the reverse procy or hardcoded in this config.
#
# It default to client side authentication.
AuthType = client


[Server Side Example]

# Performs a server side authorization
AuthType = authorization

# Reads the username from X-Forwarded-User header.
AuthUserHeader = X-Forwarded-User

# Sets the username which can the the proxy authorization
AuthSieveUser = admin
# Sets the password of the user capable to to the proxy authorization.
AuthSievePassword = password


[Client Side Example]

# Performs a client side authentication
AuthType = client

# Typically the username is extracted from the given header which is injected
# by a reverse proxy.
AuthUserHeader = X-Forwarded-User

# But if you are configuring a single user environment you can also specify a
# fixed username which should be used for all client side request.
#
# If specified the AuthUSerHeader will be ignored.
#AuthUser = username
