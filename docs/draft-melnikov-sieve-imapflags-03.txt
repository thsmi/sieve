Abstract

   Recent discussions   have  shown  that  it  is  desirable  to  set
   different [IMAP] flags on message delivery.  This can be done, for
   example, by a SIEVE interpreter that works as a part of a Mail Delivery
   Agent.

   This document describes an extension to the  Sieve  mail  filtering
   language for setting [IMAP] flags. The extension allows to set both 
   [IMAP] system flags and [IMAP] keywords.


0. Meta-information on this draft

   This information  is intended to facilitate discussion.  It will be
   removed when this document leaves the Internet-Draft stage.


0.1. Discussion

   This draft is intended to be compared with the Sieve mail filtering
   language,  an  Internet-Draft  being  discussed  on the MTA Filters
   mailing list at <ietf-mta-filters@imc.org>.  Subscription  requests
   can  be  sent  to <ietf-mta-filters-request@imc.org> (send an email
   message with the word "subscribe" in the body). More information on
   the  mailing  list  along  with  a  WWW archive of back messages is
   available at <http://www.imc.org/ietf-mta-filters/>.


0.2. Changes from the version submitted to the SIEVE mailing list

   1. Added addflag and removeflag actions

   2. Changed the semantics of setflag (setflag is not additive any more)

   3. Corrected   section  "Interaction  with  Other  Sieve  Actions".
      Removed incorrect reference to  the  forward  action  as  to  an
      action that prohibits setflag.

   4. Added  paragraph  about  the  mutual  order of fileinto/keep and
      setflag/addflag/removeflag actions.


0.3. Changes from the revision 00

   1. Corrected Capability Identifier section (Section 2)

   2. Corrected "Interaction with Other Sieve Actions" section (Section 4)

   3. Examples were updated to be compatible with Sieve-07 draft

   4. Added "mark" and "unmark" actions


0.4. Changes from the revision 01

   2. Clarified that the extension allows to set both IMAP System
      Flags and Keywords


0.5. Changes from the revision 02

   1. BugFix: all backslashes must be escaped

   2. Added extended example and more detailed description of
      addflag/removeflag additivity.

   3. Minor example bugfixes


1. Introduction

   This is  an  extension to the Sieve language defined by [SIEVE] for
   setting [IMAP] flags.  It defines several  new  actions  "setflag",
   "addflag", "removeflag", "mark" and "unmark".

   This document  doesn't dictate how the SIEVE interpreter will set the [IMAP]
   flags. In particular, the SIEVE interpreter may work as an IMAP client,
   or may have direct access to the mailstore.

   SIEVE interpreters  that  don't  support  integration  with IMAP
   SHOULD ignore this extension.

   Conventions for notations are as in [SIEVE] section 1.1,  including
   use of [KEYWORDS].


2. Capability Identifier

   The capability string associated with extension defined in this document
   is "imapflags".


3. Actions

   All actions described in this specification (setflag, addflag, removeflag,
   mark, unmark) operate on an internal variable that contains the set
   of [IMAP] flags associated with the message being delivered. When
   the interpreter starts executing a script this variable contains an
   empty set. The 'addflag' action adds flags to the existing set. The
   'removeflag' action removes flags from the existing set.  The
   'setflag' action replaces the existing set of flags with a new set.
   Whenever the interpreter encounters a 'fileinto' or 'keep' action
   it files the message with the current set of flags.


3.1. Setflag Action

   Syntax:   setflag <list-of-flags>

   Setflag is used for setting  [IMAP]  system flags or keywords. Setflag
   replaces  any previously  set  flags.  It  should  be  used
   together with keep or fileinto.  It MUST be ignored  if  mailstore
   or target mailbox doesn't support  the storing of any flags.

   Flags can  be  set  only for the message that is currently being
   processed by SIEVE.  When called with keep, setflag sets flags in
   the user's  main mailbox.  When  called  with  fileinto,  setflag
   sets flags in the mailbox indicated by the parameter.

   The order of setflag/fileinto or setflag/keep is important  in  the
   script. Any setflag action applies only to subsequent fileinto/keep
   actions in a script till next occurence of
   setflag/addflag/removeflag/mark/unmark. 

   Server MUST ignore all flags that it can't store permanently.  This
   means,  in  particular,  that if the user's main mailbox can't store any
   flags, then the following SIEVE script produces no actions

      Example:  if size :over 500K {
                    setflag "\\Deleted";
                }

   A more substantial example is:

      Example:
        if header :contains "from" "boss@frobnitzm.edu" {
          setflag "\\Flagged";
          fileinto "INBOX.From Boss";
        }


3.2. Addflag action

   Syntax:   addflag <list-of-flags>

   Addflag is used for setting [IMAP] flags. However unlike setflag it
   doesn't replace any previously set flags.  This means that multiple
   occurrences of addflag are treated additively.

   For example, the following two actions

      addflag "\\Deleted";
      addflag "\\Answered";

   produce the same result as the single action

      addflag ["\\Deleted", "\\Answered"];

   In all other  respects  addflag  behaves  the  same  way  as
   setflag.


3.3. Removeflag Action

   Syntax:   removeflag <list-of-flags>

   Removeflag is used for  setting  [IMAP]  flags.  Removeflag  clears
   flags previously set by setflag/addflag.  Calling removeflag with a
   flag that wasn't set before is not an error and is ignored.
   Multiple occurrences of removeflag are treated additively.

   In all other respects removeflag behaves  the  same  way  as
   setflag.

      Example:
        if header :contains "Disposition-Notification-To" "mel@example.com" {
          addflag "$MDNRequired";
        }
        if header :contains "from" "imap@cac.washington.edu" {
          removeflag "$MDNRequired";
          fileinto "INBOX.imap-list";
        }


3.4. Mark and Unmark Actions

   Syntax:   mark

   Syntax:   unmark

   The mark action allows a message to be marked as urgent.
   Implementers are free to choose any flag or any combination of
   [IMAP] flags,  however  it  is  RECOMMENDED  that  the [IMAP]
   \Flagged  flag be  used.  The mark  action is semantically
   equivalent to 'addflag "\\Flagged"'.

   The unmark action allows the flag previously  set  by  the Mark
   action to be unset. Unmark SHOULD at least clear the [IMAP] \Flagged flag
   and MUST clear all flags that could be added with mark.  Unmark MAY
   clear other flags as well.  The unmark action is semantically
   equivalent to 'removeflag "\\Flagged"'. 


3.5 Extended example

   #
   # Example Sieve Filter
   # Declare any optional features or extension used by the script
   #
   require ["fileinto", "reject", "imapflags"];

   #
   # Reject any large messages
   #
   if size :over 1M
           {
           if header :is "From" "boss@company.com"
                      {
                      addflag "\\Flagged $Big";
   # The message will be marked as "\Flagged $Big" when filed into
   # mailbox "Big messages" 
                      }
           fileinto "Big messages";
           }

   if header :is "From" "grandma@example.net"
           {
           addflag ["\\Answered", "$MDNSent"];
   # If the message is bigger than 1Mb it will be marked as "\Flagged
   # $Big \Answered $MDNSent"  
   # when filed into mailbox "grandma". If the message is shorter than
   # 1Mb it will be marked as "\Answered $MDNSent"
           fileinto "GrandMa";  # move to "GrandMa" folder
           }

   #
   # Handle messages from known mailing lists
   # Move messages from IETF filter discussion list to filter folder
   #
   if header :is "Sender" "owner-ietf-mta-filters@imc.org"
           {
           setflag "\\Flagged";
   # Message will always have just "\Flagged" flag
           keep;
           }

   #
   # Keep all messages to or from people in my company
   #
   elsif anyof address :domain :is ["From", "To"] "company.com"
           {
           keep;               # keep in "In" folder
           }
   #
   # Try and catch unsolicited email.  If a message is not to me,
   # or it contains a subject known to be spam, file it away.
   #
   elsif anyof (not address :all :contains
                  ["To", "Cc", "Bcc"] "me@company.com",
                header :matches "subject"
                  ["*make*money*fast*", "*university*dipl*mas*"])
           {
           removeflag "\\Flagged";
           # If message header does not contain my address,
           # it's from a list.
           fileinto "spam";   # move to "spam" folder
           }
   else
           {
           # Move all other (non-company) mail to "personal"
           # folder.
           fileinto "personal";
           }



4. Interaction with Other Sieve Actions

   Sieve actions sometimes  prohibit  each  other  in  order  to  make
   filtering scripts less likely to cause serious problems.

   It is   strongly   discouraged  to  use
   setflag/addflag/removeflag/mark/unmark actions together with
   reject,  because  that  action doesn't allow keeping  a received message.

   The SIEVE interpreter  MUST  ignore any
   setflag/addflag/removeflag/mark/unmark commands when they are used
   with  reject. The SIEVE interpreter MUST ignore these commands when
   no keep (implicit or explicit) or fileinto actions will be taken.

   A SIEVE verifier SHOULD reject a script that contains a
   setflag/addflag/removeflag/mark/unmark action together with  reject.


5. Other Considerations

   This extension intentionally doesn't allow setting [IMAP] flags  on an
   arbitrary message in the [IMAP] message store.


6. Security Considerations

   Security considerations are discussed in the [IMAP] and [SIEVE].
   It is belived that this  extension  doesn't  introduce any
   additional security concerns.


7. Formal Grammar

   The grammar used in this section is the same as the ABNF described in
   [ABNF].

   action =/ setflag / addflag / removeflag / mark / unmark

   setflag = "setflag" WSP string-list
     ;; a list of [IMAP] flags

   addflag = "addflag" WSP string-list
     ;; a list of [IMAP] flags

   removeflag = "removeflag" WSP string-list
     ;; a list of [IMAP] flags

   mark = "mark"

   unmark = "unmark"
