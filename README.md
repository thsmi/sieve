# Sieve Editor

[Sieve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_%28mail_filtering_language%29) is a
powerful scripting language for server-side mail filtering. It is intended to
be used with [IMAP](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501) which is ubiquitous.
Many IMAP Servers are capable of running Sieve filters. Sieve stores and runs
all scripts on the server-side.

Now there is the dilemma – you have access to a server supporting Sieve but how
do you manage your scripts on this server?

You can use [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) for this purpose,
but that is far too uncomfortable, not applicable for a normal user and almost
impossible with secure connections. Wouldn’t it be great to activate, edit,
delete and add Sieve scripts with a convenient interface? That is exactly what this sieve editor offers…

… it provides an implementation of [A Protocol for Remotely Managing Sieve Scripts (RFC 5804)](https://wiki.tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5804) as well as a graphical editor for [Sieve: An Email Filtering Language (RFC 5228)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5228)

## History

All started in 2006 as a very simplistic [Thunderbird addon](https://addons.thunderbird.net/addon/sieve/) implementing the manage sieve protocol. But as the years passed by the plaintext editor got more and more features and evolved into a full graphical editor.

Several years ago Mozilla made a strange decision. They dropped their very flexible addon system and copied the extremely limited WebExtensions from Google Chrome. An this ultimately meant for Thunderbird that "classic" addons will go way.

Now in 2020 classic Thunderbird addons are dead. Which meant for the addon it needed to evolve and drop its Thunderbird dependencies. It is now a _portable standalone application_!

## Status

The project is actively developed. The focus shifted from a thunderbird addon to a portable standalone app.

Status and future development plans are described in the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md). The [Capabilities page](CAPABILITIES.md) contains a list of all supported sieve and manage sieve features.
